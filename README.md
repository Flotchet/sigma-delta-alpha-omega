Sigma Delta Alpha Omega is a highly dynamic & customizable application made with incremental programming, object oriented prgramming & functional programming principles.

## What is incremental programming? 
Incremental programming is a computer programming model that organizes software design arround cores and modules. Where the cores can perfecly work without the module and where the software will continue to work without any modification to the cores if a new module is added (assuming that the module respect the cores specification).

## What is object oriented programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

## What is functional programming? 
Functional programming (FP) is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software.
